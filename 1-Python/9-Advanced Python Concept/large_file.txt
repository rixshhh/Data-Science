Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze large datasets, find patterns, and create predictive models to inform and improve decision-making. Data scientists use tools like programming languages (Python, R, SQL) to clean, analyze, and visualize data to solve complex problems.
