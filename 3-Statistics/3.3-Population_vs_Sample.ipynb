    "- It includes **all possible data points** in the group.  \n",

    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - All 100,000 people in a city.  \n",

    "## **Sample**\n",
    "- A **sample** is a **small part or subset** of the population that is selected for analysis.  \n",
    "- Denoted by **n (small letter).**  \n",
    "- It is used when studying the entire population is impractical or time-consuming.  \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - Taking data from **10,000 people (sample)** out of **100,000 (population)** to estimate average weight.  \n",
