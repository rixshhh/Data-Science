    "# **Feature Selection vs Feature Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are techniques used in **Dimensionality Reduction**, but they work in *different ways*.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **1. Feature Selection (Choosing the Best Features)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection means **selecting a subset of relevant features** from the original dataset **without modifying** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply **keep the best features** and **remove the irrelevant ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduces overfitting\n",
    "* Removes noise\n",
    "* Reduces training time\n",
    "* Makes the model easier to interpret\n",

    "\n",
    "**A. Filter Methods** (statistical tests)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use statistical scores to select features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correlation\n",
    "* Chi-square test\n",
    "* ANOVA test\n",
    "* Mutual information\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Wrapper Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Try different feature combinations and pick the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",

    "* RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)\n",
    "* Forward/Backward selection\n",

    "**C. Embedded Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is done during model training.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Extraction means **transforming existing features into new features**.\n",
    "These new features are usually **compressed**, **more informative**, and **represent hidden structure**.\n",

    "* **t-SNE**\n",

    "### **Simple Example**\n",

    "Original features:\n",
    "`[Height, Weight, BMI]`\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are correlated.\n",
