    "\n",
    "Naïve Bayes is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem.\n",
    "It is mainly used for classification problems — such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, or disease prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s called “naïve” because it assumes that all features are independent of each other, \n",
    "which rarely happens in real life — but the model still performs surprisingly well.\n",
    "\n"

    "Bayes’ Theorem provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis\n",

    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",

    "    P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",

    "Where:\n",

    "- P(B|A): Likelihood — probability of B given A\n",
    "- P(A): Prior probability — probability of A before seeing data\n",
    "- P(B): Evidence — total probability of B"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naïve Bayes:\n",
    "   - Used when features are continuous and follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.\n",
    "   - Example: Iris dataset (flower measurements)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multinomial Naïve Bayes:\n",
    "   - Used for discrete data, like word counts in text classification.\n",
    "   - Example: Spam detection, sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bernoulli Naïve Bayes:\n",
    "   - Used when features are binary (0 or 1).\n",
    "   - Example: Whether a word is present in an email or not.\n",
