    "## **1. Supervised Learning**\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "The model is trained using **labeled data** — that means both input and the correct output are known. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Feature will be continous -> Regression Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's not continous (Categorical) -> Then Classification Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are two categories we basically say it as **Binary Classification**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are multiple Categories then it becomes **MultiClass Classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "Predict outcomes for **new, unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Predicting house prices based on area, rooms, etc.  \n",
    "- Email spam detection (Spam / Not Spam)  \n",
    "- Credit risk prediction (Low / High risk)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Algorithms:**  \n",
    "- Linear Regression  \n",
    "- Logistic Regression  \n",
    "- Decision Trees  \n",
    "- Random Forest  \n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  \n",

    "## **2. Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the data is **unlabeled** — the model tries to find hidden patterns or structure in the data without knowing the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "Group or organize data based on similarity or detect hidden patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Customer segmentation in marketing  \n",
    "- Grouping news articles by topic  \n",
    "- Detecting abnormal network activity  \n",

    "**Common Algorithms:**  \n",
    "- K-Means Clustering  \n",
    "- Hierarchical Clustering  \n",
    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  \n",
